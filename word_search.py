# Word Search (Medium)
# Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists
# in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells,
# where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell
# may not be used more than once.
# Constraints:
# m == board.length
# n = board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 6
# 1 <= word.length <= 15
# board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

# Time complexity: O(n * 3Ë†l) - where n is number of cells and l is length of word. dfs
# function is called at most once for each board cell and from each cell during traversal,
# we can pick at most 3 directions to continue recursion (with exception of initial position)
# Space complexity: O(l) - l is length of word and also depth of stack for recursive dfs calls
