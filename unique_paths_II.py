# Unique Paths II (Medium)
# You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the
# top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner
# (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point
# in time. An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that
# the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle. Return the number of
# possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
# The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10Ë†9.

# Time complexity: O(n * m)
# Space complexity: O(n * m) - possible to use obstacleGrid as t list, then O(1)
