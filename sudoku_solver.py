# Sudoku Solver (Hard)
# Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
# A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
# The '.' character indicates empty cells.
# Constraints:
# board.length == 9
# board[i].length == 9
# board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
# It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

# Time complexity: n!Ë†n - n is fixed == 9 and we have 9! permutations for each row
# Space complexity: O(n) - we have bitmask for each row, column and square
