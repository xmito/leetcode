# Water and Jug Problem (Medium)
# You are given two jugs with capacities jug1Capacity and jug2Capacity liters. There is
# an infinite amount of water supply available. Determine whether it is possible to
# measure exactly targetCapacity liters using these two jugs.
# If targetCapacity liters of water are measurable, you must have targetCapacity liters
# of water contained within one or both buckets by the end. Operations allowed:
# * Fill any of the jugs with water.
# * Empty any of the jugs.
# * Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity, targetCapacity <= 10Ë†6

# Time complexity: O(jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity) - we must visit number of nodes
# Space complexity: O(jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity)
